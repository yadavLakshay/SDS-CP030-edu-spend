# 🎓 EduSpend — Budget Planner (Streamlit App)

**Author:** Lakshay Yadav  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Streamlit App & ML Models Deployed

---

## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

EduSpend is an applied, risk-aware machine learning project that provides decision support for prospective students by modeling and quantifying uncertainty in university-related expenses. The system estimates Total Cost of Attendance (TCA) and affordability tiers across universities and cities, supporting informed financial planning where cost misestimation carries real-world risk.

The project combines supervised learning, metric-driven model selection, and deployment-ready pipelines to deliver both cost estimation and affordability classification through a Streamlit-based interface.

## 🧪 MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE

The pipeline was designed to balance predictive performance with misestimation risk, emphasizing metric selection, model robustness, and reproducibility.

### 1. **Phase 1: EDA & Preprocessing**
- Cleaned international education cost data
- Engineered `TCA` as target variable
- Processed missing values, encoded categorical columns
- Exported cleaned dataset

### 2. **Phase 2: Model Development**
- Trained regression models: RandomForest, XGBoost, GradientBoosting
- Trained classification models: RandomForest, XGBoost, GradientBoosting
- Used `RandomizedSearchCV` for tuning
- Logged results and metrics using **MLflow**
- Saved best models and preprocessor with `joblib`

### 3. **Phase 3: Deployment**
- Built `app.py` in Streamlit for real-time prediction
- Integrated dynamic dropdowns (country, city, level)
- Deployed models with correct preprocessing pipeline
- Tested app locally and on Streamlit Cloud

## ⚠️ CHALLENGES FACED

### ❌ NumPy DLL Import Error
- Encountered `numpy._core.multiarray failed to import`
- 🛠️ Fixed by downgrading NumPy to `1.24.4` and rebuilding environment

### ❌ OneDrive Path Errors
- Models failed to load due to locked `.pkl` files inside OneDrive
- 🛠️ Moved entire project to a local directory

### ❌ Version Incompatibility in Deployment
- Errors due to mismatched versions of `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`, and `joblib`
- 🛠️ Fixed with a fresh environment (`eduspend3`) and strict version control

### ❌ Static UI Inputs
- Country, city, and level fields were initially hardcoded
- 🛠️ Replaced with dynamic dropdowns based on the original dataset

## 💻 HOW TO RUN LOCALLY

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the main SDS challenge repository
git clone https://github.com/SuperDataScience-Community-Projects/SDS-CP030-edu-spend.git
cd SDS-CP030-edu-spend/submissions/team-members/lakshay-yadav

# Step 2: (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Step 3: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 4: Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```
